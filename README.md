Lab 1a: Classification with a single-layer perceptron

- This lab is concerned with learning approaches for a single-layer perceptron
(also know as a threshold logic unit or McCulloch-Pitts neuron) in simple binary
classification problems. The two main learning algorithms considered in this lab
are percpetron and delta (Widrow-Hoff) rule.

Lab 4: RBM and DBN

- The focus in this projct is on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep belief nets
(DBNs)
